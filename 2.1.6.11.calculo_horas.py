#Your task is to prepare a simple code able to evaluate the end time of a period of time, 
#given as a number of minutes (it could be arbitrarily large). 
#The start time is given as a pair of hours (0..23) and minutes (0..59). 
#The result has to be printed to the console.

hour = int(input("Starting time (hours): "))
mins = int(input("Starting time (minutes): "))
dura = int(input("Event duration (minutes): "))

# put your code here
